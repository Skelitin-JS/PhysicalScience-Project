# PhysicalScience-Project

This is my project for physical science.

(Physical Science, not physics)

We were tasked with making a digital, or handwritten booklet on the planets.

This is my "Planet Booklet"

Very happy we got a while to work on it.

# HOW TO USE:

I mean its a static html page, with javascript for the navbar.

Simply host in on either replit, glitch or go to the live site.

Use of this is fine, just credit me please.
