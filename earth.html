    <h3> Earth is the 3rd Planet from the Sun</h3>
    <h3> The Earth is aproximatelly 92.685 million miles from the sun.</h3>
    <h3> The Earth is the only place in our Solar System which is habitable for life</h3>
    <h3> Earth is 71% water, the other 29% being land such as desert or grass.</h3>
    <h3> Earth is home to many creatures, landmarks, and buildings.</h3>
    <h3> Earth only has one moon, which is literally called "The Moon".</h3>
    <h3> Which is strange, because the solar system has <strong> MANY </strong> moons!</h3>
    <h3> The Earth is approximately 4000 miles in size. </h3>
    <h3> Earth's mass is roughly 5.97219 Ã— 1024^24 kilograms. WOW!</h3>
<h3> The average temperature on Earth is 57 degrees fahrenheit. </h3>
<h3> The atmosphere of the Earth is: "78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases." (yes I copied and pasted that from Google!</h3> 
<h3> The temperature on Earth has many ranges, in many different places. In Florida, it would be very sunny, while in Antartica it would be freezing!</h3>
<h3> Earth doesn't actually orbit in a perfect circle like many would be led to believe. It is actually slightly oval shaped.</h3>
<h3> The Earth takes 24 hours to complete a full rotation. It takes 365 days to complete it's orbit around the Sun.</h3>
<h3> Earth rotates the sun in a <strong> counter-clockwise</strong> rotation. I would've thought it would be clockwise. Weird.</h3> 
<h3> Earth is Earth, so it is 0 miles away from Earth...right?</h3>
<h3> Earth has a pretty basic, but cool color scheme. Earth is green, blue, and white.</h3>
<h3> Earth does not have any rings. If it did, spacetravel would be even harder. But, one day I predict it might due to space debris?</h3> 
<h3> Yes, there is life on Earth! There is over 8.7 MILLION species living on Earth!</h3>
<h3> There are many studies on Earth, since we live on it it is made much easier. There are studies about life, and how Earth works. (And more)</h3>
